The task is to build a search form for npm registry packages and display a list from the returned payload.

The presented UI should function in a similar way to [npmjs.com search results](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40emotion%2Fcore). Your design does not have to look exactly like the linked page. We are concerned more about the functionality than styling. With that being said, we are looking for consistency and the use of best practices in whichever way you choose to style the page (css-in-js, sass, css).

**You can either fork this sandbox and work on the project inside of codesandbox or export the project by going to `File > Export as Zip` on this page and uploading your work to github.**

The GET request should be made to the following endpoint: `https://api.npms.io/v2/search/suggestions?q=${queryString}`

You may use any pattern or library that you find suitable to accomplish this task.

## What we are looking for

- Does it work?
  - User can search for a package
  - Relevant packages are returned via the API request
  - Relevant packages are listed and link to their page on npm.
  - Each row should contain at least the package's name and description. Other data is considered bonus and should be added if time allows.
- Does the implementation handle loading and error states?
- Styling should be consistent and make use of best practices.
- Proper-use of life-cycle events and handlers.
- Clean, well-commented code.

## React

You may use whatever patterns and state management you prefer when working on this. The choice of libraries and state management patterns is not as important as a functioning project.

## Styling

For styling you may use css placed in './styles.css' or any css framework you would like.

If you would like to use the css prop from emotion, ensure the
following is at the top of every component file as seen in `./index.js`

```js
/* @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from '@emotion/core'
```

See [emotion.sh](https://emotion.sh) for examples and further information if needed.

## Extra Credit

- Mobile breakpoints and responsive design.
- Implement functionality to fail the API requests on purpose to test error states
  - Could be a fixed position checkbox or overlay with options
- Utilization of latest React APIs
- Dynamic theming

## Example API request

The request

```
https://api.npms.io/v2/search/suggestions?q=@emotion/core
```

Returns

```json
